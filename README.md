Still nameless game
===================

My game for Ludum Dare 30. The topic is "Connected worlds".

The story
---------

You are the transport engineer of our new and totally awesome interdimensional
transport system. This system makes it possible for persons to travel huge
distances in almost no time.  
Unfortanly it needs three memory blocks of the transport system to contain a
whole person. And the electrical inderferences are still a problem. So we need
to sets of memory blocks to not to overload the buffer system.  
Your task it is to connect the persons memory blocks manually to get the people
save out of your portal.

How to play
-----------

You get two panels with 8x8 fields. You have to get three indeferences in a row
to make them disappear. The empty fields will filled up with new indeferences in
the direction you make your move.  
Every move you make the connectors on the panel will change their content with
their partner on the other panel.  
A level ends if you saved all people on the field.  
Goal is to save as much people as you can with least possible steps. Game over
is, when you cannot make a step anymore.
